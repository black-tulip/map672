    <p>ON journeys through web maps we start,<br/>
        (Ay, through the world--urged by these instructions,<br/>
        Sailing henceforth to every module--to every manifesto;)<br/>
        We, willing learners of all [things mapping], teachers of all [things mapping], and lovers of all [things mapping].<br/>

<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2> 
    <p>I was intrigued by the manifesto simply because it attempts to lay out in one place a set of principles by which to think about the challenges that surround my particular interests in mapping. At the heart of most of the points was how maps relate to reality (more to be parsed there than these few paragraphs allow). But the most interesting, relevant and provocative point for me was point 5, because it encapsulates the heart of an ethical dilemma, rather than an issue of accuracy, representation, or priority. Point 5 states “Map or be mapped” and “Not everything should be mapped.” but before going further let me tell you about why I am here.</p>
    <p>My interest in mapping derives from how it relates to development and conflict in an international setting. The burgeoning availability of satellite imagery, cheap and sophisticated drones, and user-friendly crowd mapping platforms will change the way development stakeholders manage their projects and understand their environment. But that change will not be simple, especially in the Global South where access to technology remains a matter of fundamental inequality and research data could become an instrument of conflict. Point 5, the idea of who owns and controls your map, and whether it should be created at all, is exponentially more relevant in less developed or conflict contexts where power differentials are far greater, and the potential for exploitation a foregone conclusion. Here is a quick example: Last summer I was planning to visit my sister who was working in the refugee Camp in the city of Tyre, in Lebanon (I live in Abu Dhabi and Lebanon is an easy weekend trip). I wanted to do some mapping while I was there of the informal community that had spring up using OSM. But refugee permanence is politically sensitive. Governments or local actors have a stake in ensuring refugees don’t get too comfortable and decide to stay, with long term implications for social infrastructure and demographics. The perception of permanence is a perilous position, and placing data on an open platform like OSM could be viewed by some as a form of putting down stakes. I was worried enough about data security and how any innocent mapping might be used that I decided against it. One priority I have in my mapping career is creating a clear framework for myself in dealing with similar situations, both in assessing that risk and learning what tools are at our disposal to mitigate it. In other words, when should we not map? But if it is indeed map or be mapped, how do we go about it responsibly? </p>
    <p>I think the above mulling (and perhaps the fact that in my story, I actually avoided mapping anything) puts me in the critic camp of the coder-cartographer-critic continuum. But I also think that as our tools get smarter the coder-cartographer divide will become irrelevant. This is not to say that we won’t need map/app makers who understand the design theory and history of maps. It is they who build the next generation of mapping tools. But those tools will be closer integrated with data than ever, and will know how to recognize, categorize, and represent data largely independently of a human. At the moment I can go in cartoDB and create a beautiful map with a few intuitive clicks, but cartoDB isn’t smart enough to understand the data I’m working with. I still must choose how to represent it. Eventually my role will be limited (if I so wish) to simply putting in constraints, and letting the computer build many maps on that basis. The next manifesto might have to acknowledge a 4th C: that of the computer as a true actor, generating maps from its own place in power hierarchies.</p>
